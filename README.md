# PDF-Analyzer-chatbot
Created a kind of chatbot where by uploading the pdf you get whatever you want from the pdf 

I have also made an virtual environment for this by writing python -m venv venv in the command palette

For activating  virtual environment I use the command venv\Scripts\activate

To deactivate write deactivate

To run the code with the help of streamlit we use streamlit run filename.py in the command palett



Now I will show you the demo of our project
